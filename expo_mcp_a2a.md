I am currently working at an AWS partner company in Peru called "Amber." Over the past two weeks, I have been assigned to a proof-of-concept (POC) project aimed at building an MCP server and exploring the capabilities and potential of both MCP and A2A. As part of this initiative, I have been tasked with presenting a concise overview of the history of large language models (LLMs), covering topics from prompt engineering to the latest protocols, standards, frameworks, and tools. The objective is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of LLMs and their potential software applications for "Amber" and the Peruvian market.

Since Amber is an AWS partner, the presentation will focus on AWS services and their role in building LLM applications. Topics will include prompt engineering, structured outputs, streaming, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), function calling, tools, MCP, A2A, and more. The presentation will be concise, highlighting the most relevant information for the audience.

Below are references and links to assist in creating the presentation:

Please provide the presentation in LaTeX format for compilation in Overleaf. The presentation should be in English, well-organized, and easy to follow. It should include references and consist of 10 to 20 slides. Additionally, give me a set of 5 title candidates for the presentation. The title should be catchy and relevant to the content. The presentation should be suitable for a technical audience and non-technical audience (marketing, sales) with a null understanding of LLMs and their applications.
